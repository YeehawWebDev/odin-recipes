    <h3>Making this lasagna recipe a day ahead and refrigerating overnight allows the spices to meld and gives it exceptional flavor.</h3>
    <p>This is homemade recipe made from scratch. This recipe is sure to please everyone and bring a little taste of Italy to your kitchen.</p>
    <h2>Pasta Ingredients</h2>

    <li>320 grams all purpose flour</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>2 tsp of salt</li>
    <li>2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tsp of garlic powder</li>

    <h2>Sauce Ingredients</h2>
    <li>16 oz. fresh mozzarella</li>
    <li>7 oz. ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>4 oz. resh parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>2 28 oz. cans of crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>4 oz vodka</li>
    <li>1 white onion(diced)</li>
    <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
    <li>1 tbsp of tomato paste</li>
    <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>2 tbsp of olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tbsp of white sugar</li>
    <li>1 tbsp of salt</li>
    <li>2 tsp of black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tsp of onion powder</li>
    <li>Fresh basil</li>
    <li>Fresh chopped oregano</li>
    <li>Fresh chopped rosemary</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>1. First things first. The sauce.</ol>
    <p>I really love to start with my sauce first so that all the ingredients have time to cook together.</p>

    <ol>2. Second, we will make the pasta.</ol>
    <p>Mix all dry ingredients in mixing bowl. Then add wet ingredients. Mix all ingredients with dough hook on medium speed until everthing is evenly mixed.</p>
    <ol>3. Finally, we will combine our ingredients and make our lasagna.</ol>
    <p>Let's start by greasing our pan with some butter, eevo, or some cooking spray. Now spread a little sauce down very lightly before we put down our first layer. For our first layer we are going to lay down our lasagna noodles long ways in out casserole
        baking dish. After that will evenly spread our sauce, add a few dallops or ricotta cheese, a few pieces of our mozzarella and sprinkle on that fresh parmesan. I like to cover lightly the mozzarella and ricotta with the sauce as well before we
        add our next layer of noodle. You are going to repeat this process 2-3 more times depending on how many layers you want. You will want to end the process with the top layer being your sauce with the cheeses and sprinkle on that chopped basil.
